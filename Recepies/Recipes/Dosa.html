    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Dosa is a savory, thin crepe from South India made from a fermented batter of rice and black lentils. 
        It's a popular breakfast or dinner dish, known for its crispy texture and delicious flavor. 
        The key ingredients are <b>rice, black lentils</b> (urad dal), and a small amount of <b>fenugreek seeds</b> (methi), 
        which help in the fermentation process. The preparation involves soaking the rice and lentils for several hours before grinding them into a smooth, 
        thick batter. This batter is then left to ferment overnight, a crucial step that gives the dosa its characteristic sour taste and light texture. 
        Once fermented, the batter is spread thinly on a hot griddle, cooked until golden-brown and crispy, and then folded or rolled. 
        It's typically served with coconut chutney and a warm, spiced lentil-based stew called sambar.
