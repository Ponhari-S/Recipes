    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Chapati is a popular, unleavened flatbread from the Indian subcontinent, made from whole wheat flour (atta). It is a staple food in many Indian households and is known for its soft, pliable texture when fresh. 
        Unlike other breads, chapati is made without yeast and is cooked on a dry griddle (tawa), often puffed up on a direct flame, which makes it light and airy. 
        It is the perfect accompaniment to a wide variety of curries, vegetables, and lentil dishes, and its neutral flavor allows it to complement almost any meal.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole Wheet Flour</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Process:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Kneading the Dough:</b>  In a large bowl, combine the atta, salt, and a little oil (if using). Gradually add warm water while mixing and kneading the dough with your hands. Knead for about 5-7 minutes until the dough is smooth, soft, and elastic.</li>
        <li><b>Resting the Dough:</b> Cover the kneaded dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. This resting period allows the gluten to relax, which makes the chapatis easier to roll and helps them puff up when cooked.</li>
        <li><b>Rolling the Chapatis: </b> Divide the dough into small, equal-sized balls. Take one ball and lightly flatten it with your palm. Dip it in dry flour (atta) and roll it out into a thin, even circle using a rolling pin.</li>
        <li><b>Cooking on a Tawa:</b> Heat a tawa (a flat iron griddle) over medium-high heat. Place the rolled chapati on the hot tawa. Cook for about 20-30 seconds, or until small bubbles start to appear.</li>
        <li><b>Puffing the Chapati:</b> Flip the chapati to the other side and cook for another 30 seconds. For a puffed chapati (phulka), you can either place it directly over a low to medium gas flame using tongs, or press down on it with a clean cloth on the griddle. It should puff up into a soft balloon.</li>
        <li><b>Serving:</b> Immediately remove the chapati from the heat, brush it with a little ghee (if desired), and serve it hot. To keep them soft, stack the chapatis in an insulated container lined with a cloth.</li>
