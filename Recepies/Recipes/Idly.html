    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Idly is a soft, fluffy, and savory steamed cake from South India, made from a fermented batter of ground rice and black lentils (urad dal). 
        It is a staple breakfast food, beloved for its light, spongy texture and easy digestibility, making it a healthy and nourishing meal. 
        The fermentation process gives idly its distinct, slightly tangy flavor and makes it airy. 
        Idly is usually served in pairs with traditional side dishes like sambar (a vegetable and lentil stew) and various types of coconut or tomato chutneys. 
        It is a fundamental part of South Indian cuisine and is enjoyed by people of all ages.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Idly Rice</li>
        <li>Urad Dal</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Fenugreek Seeds </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Process:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Soaking:</b> Begin by thoroughly washing the rice and urad dal in separate bowls until the water runs clear. Soak the rice for 4-6 hours, and the lentils with the fenugreek seeds for at least 4 hours.</li>
        <li><b>Grinding:</b> After soaking, drain the water. First, grind the urad dal and fenugreek seeds into a very smooth and fluffy paste using a wet grinder or high-powered blender. Then, grind the rice into a slightly coarser paste. Mix both batters together in a large container.</li>
        <li><b>Fermentation:</b> Cover the container and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours. The batter will naturally rise and become bubbly and spongy. This fermentation process is key to the idlies' light texture.</li>
        <li><b>Seasoning:</b> Gently stir salt into the fermented batter. Be careful not to mix too vigorously, as you want to preserve the air bubbles created during fermentation. The batter should have a pouring consistency.</li>
        <li><b>Steaming:</b> Lightly grease the idly molds with a little oil. Pour the batter into each mold, filling them about three-quarters full. Place the idly stand in a steamer with boiling water and steam for 10-15 minutes. The idlies are done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><b>Serving:</b> Once steamed, let the idlies cool for a few minutes before removing them from the molds. Serve the warm, soft idlies immediately with traditional side dishes like sambar and chutney.</li>
